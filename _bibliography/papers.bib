  abstract     = {Database management system (DBMS) is a critical component of modern data-intensive applications. Developers adopt many testing techniques to detect and fix DBMS bugs such as crashes and assertion failures. However, most of the previous efforts cannot detect logical bugs that render the DBMS returns incorrect results. Recent work proposed several oracles to identify incorrect results, but they rely on rule-based expression generation to synthesize queries without any guidance. <br><br> In this paper, we propose to combine coverage-based guidance, validity-oriented mutations and oracles to detect logical bugs for DBMS systems. To achieve our goal, we first design a set of general APIs to decouple the logic of fuzzers and oracles, so that developers can easily port fuzzing tools to test DBMSs and write new oracles for existing fuzzers. We further provide validity-oriented mutations to generate high-quality query statements so as to find more logical bugs. Our prototype, SQLRight, outperforms existing tools that only rely on oracles or code coverage. It in total detects 18 logical bugs from three well-tested DBMSs, SQLite, PostgreSQL and MySQL. At the time of paper writing, all bugs have been confirmed and 13 of them are fixed.},

  title={Optimization of Buffer Networks via DC Programming}, 
  author={Zhao, Chengyan and Sakurama, Kazunori and Ogura, Masaki},
  journal={IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs}, 
  abstract={This brief is concerned with the H2 and H∞ norm-constrained optimization problems of dynamic buffer networks. The extended network model is introduced first, wherein the weights of all edges can be tuned independently. Because of the emerging nonconvexity of the extended model, previous results of positive linear systems failed to address this situation. By resorting to the log–log convexity of a class of nonlinear functions called posynomials, the optimization problems can be reduced to differential convex programming problems. The proposed framework is illustrated for large-scale networks.},

  title={Data-Driven Iterative Learning LQG Control of Axial-Gap 5-DOF Self-Bearing Motor (To appear)}, 
  author={Li, Bo and Ueno, Satoshi and Zhao, Chengyan},
  booktitle={2022 International Conference on Advanced Mechatronic Systems (ICAMechS)}, 
  abstract={This paper studies the displacement control of the tilt-controlling axial-gap self-bearing motor with single stator. We first work out with the state space description for the motor. To design the control strategy, we adopt Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) control to design the balance controller. It is known to us that the selection of matrices Q and R are always determined autonomously, which in terms results to less than perfect control performance in real applications. To overcome this situation, we propose an off-line data-based optimizer to replace the matrices selection process by using fruit fly optimization algorithm (FOA). Finally, the effectiveness of our results are verified through the comparison with LQG by simulation experiments.},
