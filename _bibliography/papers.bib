  journal={IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs}, 
  abstract={This brief is concerned with the H2 and H∞ norm-constrained optimization problems of dynamic buffer networks. The extended network model is introduced first, wherein the weights of all edges can be tuned independently. Because of the emerging nonconvexity of the extended model, previous results of positive linear systems failed to address this situation. By resorting to the log–log convexity of a class of nonlinear functions called posynomials, the optimization problems can be reduced to differential convex programming problems. The proposed framework is illustrated for large-scale networks.},

  title={Data-Driven Iterative Learning LQG Control of Axial-Gap 5-DOF Self-Bearing Motor (To appear)}, 
  author={Li, Bo and Ueno, Satoshi and Zhao, Chengyan},
  booktitle={2022 International Conference on Advanced Mechatronic Systems (ICAMechS)}, 
  abstract={This paper studies the displacement control of the tilt-controlling axial-gap self-bearing motor with single stator. We first work out with the state space description for the motor. To design the control strategy, we adopt Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) control to design the balance controller. It is known to us that the selection of matrices Q and R are always determined autonomously, which in terms results to less than perfect control performance in real applications. To overcome this situation, we propose an off-line data-based optimizer to replace the matrices selection process by using fruit fly optimization algorithm (FOA). Finally, the effectiveness of our results are verified through the comparison with LQG by simulation experiments.},

  title={Stability optimization of positive semi-Markov jump linear systems via convex optimization},
  abstract={In this paper, we study the problem of optimizing the stability of positive semi-Markov jump linear systems. We specifically consider the problems of tuning the coefficients of the system matrices for maximizing the exponential decay rate of the system under a budget-constraint and minimizing the parameter tuning cost under the decay rate constraint. By using a result from the matrix theory on the log-log convexity of the spectral radius of nonnegative matrices, we show that the stability optimization problems are reduced to convex optimization problems under certain regularity conditions on the system matrices and the cost function. We illustrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed results by using an example from the population biology.},
